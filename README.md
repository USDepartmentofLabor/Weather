Weather
=======

This class is used to access NOAA data for the OSHA Heat Safety App (v.2 prototype).  The object makes an hour-by-hour seven day forecast available in an array of structs.  The PerceivedTemperature class can be used independently of the Weather class.  However, PerceivedTemperature is a dependency of Weather.
